# Finding prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes and Sieve of Atkin algorithms with Multithreading

## Description
The project makes use of multithreaded support for two prime number algorithms, namely **Sieve of Eratosthenes** and the **Sieve of Atkin**. The results are really significant performance improvements due to spreading the calculations across several threads and can handle larger ranges of numbers.
The two algorithms were tested on the ranges (100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000) and each range was tested on multiple threads (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).

## 1. Segmented Sieve Algorithm

The Segmented Sieve algorithm was applied across several ranges, using different thread counts. The following table captures the execution time and the number of primes found for each range.

| Range          | Threads | Time (ms)  | Primes Count |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| [2, 1,000,000]   | 1       | 141.05     | 78,498       |
|                | 2       | 119.15     | -            |
|                | 4       | 121.83     | -            |
|                | 8       | 134.60     | -            |
| [2, 10,000,000]  | 1       | 500.00     | 664,579      |
|                | 2       | 296.37     | -            |
|                | 4       | 413.09     | -            |
|                | 8       | 540.31     | -            |
| [2, 100,000,000] | 1       | 2,985.83   | 5,761,455    |
|                | 2       | 2,121.81   | -            |
|                | 4       | 1,774.18   | -            |
|                | 8       | 2,435.20   | -            |
| [2, 1,000,000,000]| 1      | 22,309.12  | 50,847,534   |
|                | 2       | 16,630.84  | -            |
|                | 4       | 12,567.26  | -            |
|                | 8       | 20,682.91  | -            |

### Observations:
- As the range increases, multithreading significantly reduces execution time.
- On average, using **4 threads** was found to be the most optimal for performance, aligning with the number of virtual threads on the machine used for testing (Intel Core i3, 4th Gen, 2 cores, 4 threads).
  
### CPU and Memory Usage:
- For large ranges (100,000,000 and above), we observed increased CPU usage and memory allocation.
- During execution, memory consumption reached approximately 1.4 GB for the largest range tested.

## 2. Sieve of Atkin Algorithm

The Sieve of Atkin algorithm was also tested across various ranges and thread counts. The following table highlights the execution times and prime counts.

| Range          | Threads | Time (ms)  | Primes Count |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| [2, 1,000,000]   | 1       | 96.58      | 78,498       |
|                | 2       | 144.11     | -            |
|                | 4       | 121.83     | -            |
|                | 8       | 125.07     | -            |
| [2, 10,000,000]  | 1       | 562.11     | 664,579      |
|                | 2       | 373.85     | -            |
|                | 4       | 409.56     | -            |
|                | 8       | 490.47     | -            |
| [2, 100,000,000] | 1       | 3,744.61   | 5,761,455    |
|                | 2       | 3,324.49   | -            |
|                | 4       | 3,182.80   | -            |
|                | 8       | 3,400.70   | -            |

### Observations:
- The Sieve of Atkin performs better on smaller ranges compared to the Segmented Sieve.
- Similar to the first algorithm, **4 threads** proved optimal for performance, again reflecting the available CPU threads on the test machine.
  
#### Performance Limitations:
- Testing on the 1,000,000,000 range resulted in a **Java Out of Memory** exception, indicating that this algorithm is more memory-intensive than the Segmented Sieve.

#### CPU & Memory Statistics:
- **Range [2, 100,000,000]:**
  - **2 Threads:**  
    ![CPU Usage - 2 Threads](./images/Atkin/2.PNG)
  - **4 Threads:**  
    ![CPU Usage - 2 Threads](./images/Atkin/4.PNG)
  - **8 Threads:**

## 3. Summary & Conclusion

- **Segmented Sieve** performs better for larger ranges and is more memory-efficient.
- **Sieve of Atkin** excels in smaller ranges but struggles with larger ranges, especially in terms of memory usage.
- The tests and statistics are dependent on the hardware capabilities of the test machine. For the test environment (Intel Core i3, 4th Gen), **4 threads** provided optimal performance.
  
In conclusion, the **Segmented Sieve** is more suitable for larger datasets and is generally more efficient in terms of both performance and memory usage.

**Note:** The performance of both algorithms may vary based on system specifications and CPU load during testing.
